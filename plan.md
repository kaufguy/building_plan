## Implementation Guidelines for AI Agents

### When Working on Map Components:
- Always consider coordinate system consistency across floors
- Implement proper error handling for missing floor plans or location data
- Ensure map interactions work on both desktop and mobile devices
- Test zoom levels and ensure UI elements remain accessible

### When Working on Routing Logic:
- Consider real-world constraints (hallway widths, accessibility requirements)
- Account for dynamic obstacles or temporarily closed areas
- Implement fallback routes when primary paths are unavailable
- Test edge cases like routing between distant floors

### When Working on UI Components:
- Follow established design system and component patterns
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Implement proper loading states and error boundaries
- Test components in isolation and within the full application context

### Data Management:
- Validate all location and route data before processing
- Implement proper error handling for malformed data
- Consider performance implications of large location datasets
- Use TypeScript strictly to prevent runtime errors

### Testing Requirements:
- Write tests for all pathfinding algorithms
- Test route calculations with various building layouts
- Verify accessibility features work correctly
- Test performance with realistic data volumes

## Success Metrics

- **Usability**: Users can find any location within 3 clicks/taps
- **Performance**: Map renders and routes calculate in <2 seconds
- **Accessibility**: Fully compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Accuracy**: Route instructions lead users to correct destinations 95%+ of the time
- **Responsiveness**: Application works seamlessly on devices from mobile to desktop

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Real-time Features**
   - Live occupancy data for locations
   - Real-time route updates based on temporary closures
   - Integration with building management systems

2. **Advanced Navigation**
   - AR-based navigation using device cameras
   - Voice-guided navigation
   - Integration with building's digital displays

3. **Social Features**
   - User reviews and ratings for locations
   - Crowd-sourced accessibility information
   - Social check-ins and location sharing

4. **Analytics and Optimization**
   - User behavior analytics for route optimization
   - Popular destination tracking
   - Building traffic pattern analysis

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing a sophisticated building navigation system. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation while progressively adding advanced features.
